You'll need a index.js file that changes state and handles input 


class Card extends Component from React.  

Set up state 
state = {

}

handleClick = event => { 
    run function to see if card is already guessed or not.  If it is, break game.  If not, continue game and reshuffle. 
}


render() {
    this will be where we listen for clicks and fire the 'onChange' or probably 'onClick' 
}
