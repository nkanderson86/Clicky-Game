# Clicky-Game

Note to TA: I am having some serious issues with GitHub at the moment and can't seem to get the commits I'm making to flow up to the deployed version at https://nkanderson86.github.io/Clicky-Game/.   My last commit deleted the index.js file for some reason so I had to manually add that back and I think in the process I've screwed some things up. 

I have a local copy that is rendering all of the site components, just without the game logic.  If I can get it uploaded before class you'll see it, but just wanted to put this here to give you the heads up in case all you see if the "I'm working" page.
